# Missing Financial Data Result Replication Code

## Data

The data file we have provided `raw_rank_trunk_chars.npz` should be placed in the `data/` directory in the project if it is not already there.

### Notes about Data

Note, there are two differences between the data-set we have provided and the data-set used in the paper
1. The data-set we have provided is a truncated version of the data-set in the paper. This is because the full data-set is around 20 GB, and running all the results requires making multiple copies of the data-set, which is very time and space consuming. To subset the data, we have simply taken the last 5 years of the data.
2. The returns in the data-set we have provided have been altered such as not to violate the terms of service from their source, we have done this by adding noise to them; specifically we have added a sample of a Normal(0, 0.1) variable to each return. Therefore, one should not expect this data to replicate any of the paper results concerning returns, nor should it replicate standard results. The permos corresponding to returns have not been modified in any way, and therefore users with WRDS access can easily replace the contaminated returns with the correct returns. 

## Running the Code

#### NOTE all of the commands below expect that the user is running them from the base directory of the repository

1. install the required packages `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. create the necessary directions `$ ./setup_directories.sh`

3. generate the masked data `$ cd src && python generate_masked_data.py`

4. run the imputations `$ cd src && python run_data_imputations.py`

5. run the desired notebook for the particular results in question, ensure to run the first cell of the notebook to import the required modules and load the required data. to start the notebook server run `$ cd src && jupyter notebook`
- We have indicated in each result in the notebook how long it took us to run on a Macbook Pro with 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 for memory.
- Some of the results take quite some time to run (for example the simulations).
- Generating the data and running the imputations should take on the order of an hour or two


## Paper Results and Their Locations
Each of the paper results can be found in the notebook corresponding to it's section in the paper. 
- src/appendix.ipynb
- src/section2.ipynb
- src/section3.ipynb
- src/section4.ipynb
- src/section5.ipynb
- src/section6.ipynb

Within each notebook, the first cell corresponds to data-loading and imports, and then each section corresponds to a table or figure from the text. These are clearly labeled along with a description of what is being done. Running the cell corresponding to a result will produce and display the table or figure for the result as well as writing either a pdf of the plot for figures or a tex file of the table for tables to the `images-pdfs` directory. Additionally, below we have listed (1) the notebook containing each result in the paper (2) the file and line number of the code to generate that result in the repository and (3) the location of files which are generated for that plot.
